# Simple CSV Parser in Rust

Created this simple csv parser in Rust to learn about the programming language :)

## How to use

Not that I think you'll be using it, but, if you want to give a try...

_(Assuming you have Rust properly set on your OS)_

1. Add the file you want to process in the folder `data/input`;
    1. **NOTE:** Important to let only **one** file there.
2. Customize the `// Headers Position` part and where it's being used on the code;
3. Change the data of `headers_to_write` variable as you like;
4. Run `cargo run`
5. That's it ^^
